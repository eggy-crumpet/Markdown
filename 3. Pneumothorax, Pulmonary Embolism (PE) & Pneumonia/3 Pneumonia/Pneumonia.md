# Description
Respiratory diseases are rampant today because it is easier spread in crowded areas. Pneumonia is one of the most common respiratory problems and it affects all stages of life.

- [ ] **Pneumonia** is an **inflammation of the lung parenchyma** caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses.
- [ ] **Pneumonitis** is a more general term that describes the **inflammatory process in the lung tissue** that may predispose and place the patient at risk for microbial invasion.

# Classification
Pneumonia is classified into four: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), pneumonia in the immunocompromised host, and aspiration pneumonia.

## Community-Acquired Pneumonia

- [ ] CAP occurs either in the community setting or within the **first 48 hours after hospitalization.**
- [ ] The **causative agents** for CAP that needs hospitalization include **streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenza, Legionella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.**
- [ ] Only in 50% of the cases does the specific etiologic agent become identified.
- [ ] **Pneumonia** is the **most common cause of CAP** in people younger than 60 years of age.
- [ ] Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in infants and children.

## Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia
- [ ] HAP is also called **nosocomial pneumonia** and is defined as the onset of pneumonia symptoms **more than 48 hours after admission** in patients with no evidence of infection at the time of admission.
- [ ] HAP is the **most lethal nosocomial infection** and the leading cause of death in patients with such infections.
- [ ] Common microorganisms that are responsible for HAP include **Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, influenza, Klebsiella species, Proteus, Serratia marcescens, S. aureus**, and **S. pneumonia.**
- [ ] The usual presentation of HAP is a **new pulmonary infiltrate** on chest x-ray combined with evidence of infection.

## Pneumonia in the Immunocompromised Host
- [ ] Pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts includes Pneumocystis pneumonia, fungal pneumonias and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
- [ ] Patients who are immunocompromised **commonly develop pneumonia from organisms of low virulence.**
- [ ] Pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts may be caused by the organisms also observe in HAP and CAP.

## Aspiration Pneumonia
- [ ] **Aspiration pneumonia refers** to the pulmonary consequences resulting from entry of endogenous or exogenous substances into the lower airway.
- [ ] The most common form of aspiration pneumonia is a bacterial infection from aspiration of bacteria that normally reside in the upper airways.
- [ ] Aspiration pneumonia may occur in the community or hospital setting.
- [ ] Common pathogens are S. pneumonia, H.influenza, and S. aureus.

# Pathophysiology
Having an idea about the disease process helps the patient understand the treatment regimen and its importance, increasing patient compliance.



- [ ] Pneumonia arises from **normal flora** present in patients whose **resistance has been altered** or from aspiration of flora present in the oropharynx.
- [ ] An **inflammatory reaction** may occur in the alveoli, producing **exudates** that interfere with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
- [ ] **White blood cells** also migrate into the alveoli and **fill the normally air-filled spaces.**
- [ ] Due to secretions and mucosal edema, there are areas of the lung that are not adequately ventilated and cause partial occlusion of the alveoli or bronchi.
- [ ] **Hypoventilation** may follow, causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
- [ ] Venous blood entering the pulmonary circulation passes through the under ventilated areas and travels to the left side of the heart deoxygenated.
- [ ] The mixing of oxygenated and poorly oxygenated blood can result to **arterial hypoxemia.**

# Epidemiology
Pneumonia has affected a lot of people, especially those who have a weak immune system. Learning statistics on pneumonia could give you an idea about how many has fallen victim to this respiratory disease.

- [ ] Pneumonia and influenza account for nearly **60,000 deaths annually.**
- [ ] Pneumonia also ranks as the **eighth leading cause of death** in the United States.
- [ ] It is estimated that more than 915, 000 episodes of CAP occur in adults 65 years old and above in the United States.
- [ ] HAP accounts for 15% of hospital-acquired infections and is the leading cause of death in patients with such infections.
- [ ] The estimated incidence of HAP 4 to 7 episodes per 1000 hospitalizations.

# Causes
Each type of pneumonia is caused by different and several factors.

## Community-Acquired Pneumonia

- [ ] **Streptococcus pneumoniae.** This is the **leading cause of CAP** in people younger than 60 years of age without comorbidity and in those 60 years and older with comorbidity.
- [ ] **Haemophilus influenzae.**  This causes a type of CAP that frequently affects elderly people and those with comorbid illnesses.
- [ ] **Mycoplasma pneumoniae.**

## Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia

- [ ] **Staphylococcus aureus.** Staphylococcus pneumonia occurs through inhalation of the organism.
**Impaired host defenses.** When the defenses of the body are down, several pathogens may invade the body.
- [ ] **Comorbid conditions.** There are several conditions that lower the immune system, causing bacteria to pool in the lungs and eventually result in pneumonia.
- [ ] **Supine positioning.** When the patient stays in a prolonged supine position, fluid in the lungs pools down and stays stagnant, making it a breeding place for bacteria.
- [ ] **Prolonged hospitalization.** The risk for hospital infections or nosocomial infections increases the longer the patient stays in the hospital.

# Clinical Manifestations
Pneumonia varies in its signs and symptoms depending on its type but it is not impossible to diagnose a specific pneumonia through its clinical manifestations.

![](assets/Pneumonia-Symptoms.png)

Clinical Manifestations of Pneumonia
- [ ] **Rapidly rising fever.** Since there is inflammation of the lung parenchyma, fever develops as part of the signs of an infection.
- [ ] **Pleuritic chest pain.** Deep breathing and coughing aggravate the pain in the chest.
- [ ] **Rapid and bounding pulse.** A rapid heartbeat occurs because the body compensates for the low concentration of oxygen in the body.
- [ ] **Tachypnea.** There is fast breathing because the body tries to compensate for the low oxygen concentration in the body.
- [ ] **Purulent sputum.** The sputum becomes purulent because of the infection in the lung parenchyma which produced sputum-filled with pus.

# Prevention
It is better to prevent the occurrence of pneumonia instead of treating the disease itself. Here are several ways that can help prevent pneumonia.

- [ ] **Pneumococcal vaccine.** This vaccine can prevent pneumonia in healthy patients with an **efficiency of 65% to 85%.**
- [ ] **Staff education.** To help prevent HAP, the CDC (2004) encouraged staff education and involvement in infection prevention.
- [ ] **Infection and microbiologic surveillance.** It is important to carefully observe the infection so that there could be an appropriate application of prevention techniques.
- [ ] **Modifying host risk for infection.** The infection should never be allowed to descend on any host, so the risk must be decreased before it can affect one.

# Complications
Pneumonia has several complications if left untreated or the interventions are inappropriate. These are the following complications that may develop in patients with pneumonia.

- [ ] **Shock and respiratory failure.** These complications are encountered chiefly in patients who have received no specific treatment and inadequate or delayed treatment.
- [ ] **Pleural effusion.** In **pleural effusion,** the fluid is sent to the laboratory for analysis, and there are three stages: uncomplicated, complicated, and thoracic empyema.

# Assessment and Diagnostic Findings
Assessment and diagnosis of pneumonia must be accurate since there are a lot of respiratory problems that have similar manifestations. The following are assessments and diagnostic tests that could determine pneumonia.

- [ ] **History taking.** The diagnosis of pneumonia is made through history taking, particularly a recent respiratory tract infection.
- [ ] **Physical examination.** Mainly, the number of breaths per minute and breath sounds is assessed during physical examination.
- [ ] **Chest x-ray.** Identifies structural distribution (e.g., lobar, bronchial); may also reveal multiple abscesses/infiltrates, empyema (staphylococcus); scattered or localized infiltration (bacterial); or diffuse/extensive nodular infiltrates (more often viral). In mycoplasmal pneumonia, chest x-ray may be clear.
- [ ] **Fiberoptic bronchoscopy.** May be both diagnostic (qualitative cultures) and therapeutic (re-expansion of lung segment).
- [ ] **ABGs/pulse oximetry.** Abnormalities may be present, depending on extent of lung involvement and underlying lung disease.
- [ ] **Gram stain/cultures.** Sputum collection; needle aspiration of empyema, pleural, and transtracheal or transthoracic fluids; lung biopsies and blood cultures may be done to recover causative organism. More than one type of organism may be present; common bacteria include Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, a-hemolytic streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae; cytomegalovirus (CMV). Note: Sputum cultures may not identify all offending organisms. Blood cultures may show transient bacteremia.
- [ ] **CBC.** Leukocytosis usually present, although a low white blood cell (WBC) count may be present in viral infection, immunosuppressed conditions such as AIDS, and overwhelming bacterial pneumonia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated.
- [ ] **Serologic studies, e.g., viral or Legionella titers, cold agglutinins.** Assist in differential diagnosis of specific organism.
- [ ] **Pulmonary function studies.** Volumes may be decreased (congestion and alveolar collapse); airway pressure may be increased and compliance decreased. Shunting is present (hypoxemia).
- [ ] **Electrolytes.** Sodium and chloride levels may be low.
- [ ] **Bilirubin.** May be increased.
- [ ] **Percutaneous aspiration/open biopsy of lung tissues.** May reveal typical intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions (CMV), characteristic giant cells (rubeola).

# Medical Management
The management of pneumonia centers is a step-by-step process that zeroes on the treatment of the infection through identification of the causative agent.

- [ ] **Blood culture.** Blood culture is performed for identification of the causal pathogen and prompt administration of antibiotics in patients in whom CAP is strongly suspected.
- [ ] **Administration of macrolides.** Macrolides are recommended for people with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae.
- [ ] Hydration is an important part of the regimen because fever and tachypnea may result in insensible fluid losses.
- [ ] **Administration of antipyretics.** Antipyretics are used to treat fever and headache.
- [ ] **Administration of antitussives.** Antitussives are used for treatment of the associated cough.
- [ ] **Bed rest.** Complete rest is prescribed until signs of infection are diminished.
- [ ] **Oxygen administration.** Oxygen can be given if hypoxemia develops.
- [ ] **Pulse oximetry.** Pulse oximetry is used to determine the need for oxygen and to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.
- [ ] **Aggressive respiratory measures.** Other measures include administration of high concentrations of oxygen, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation.

# Nursing Management
Nurses are expected to perform both dependent and independent functions for the patient to aid him or her towards the restoration of their well-being.

## Nursing Assessment
Nursing assessment is critical in detecting pneumonia. Here are some tips for your nursing assessment for pneumonia.

- [ ] **Assess respiratory symptoms.** Symptoms of fever, chills, or night sweats in a patient should be reported immediately to the nurse as these can be signs of bacterial pneumonia.
- [ ] **Assess clinical manifestations.** Respiratory assessment should further identify clinical manifestations such as pleuritic pain, bradycardia, tachypnea, and fatigue, use of accessory muscles for breathing, coughing, and purulent sputum.
- [ ] **Physical assessment.** Assess the changes in temperature and pulse; amount, odor, and color of secretions; frequency and severity of cough; degree of tachypnea or shortness of breath; and changes in the chest x-ray findings.
- [ ] **Assessment in elderly patients.** Assess elderly patients for altered mental status, dehydration, unusual behavior, excessive fatigue, and concomitant heart failure.

## Diagnosis
Through the data collected during assessment, the following nursing diagnoses are made:

- [ ] **Ineffective airway clearance** related to copious tracheobronchial secretions.
- [ ] **Activity intolerance** related to impaired respiratory function.
- [ ] **Risk for deficient fluid volume** related to fever and a rapid respiratory rate.

## Nursing Care Planning & Goals

Planning is essential to establish the interventions that are appropriate for the patientâ€™s condition.

- [ ] Improve airway patency.
- [ ] Rest to conserve energy.
- [ ] Maintenance of proper fluid volume.
- [ ] Maintenance of adequate nutrition.
- [ ] Understanding of treatment protocol and preventive measures.
- [ ] Absence of complications.

## Nursing Priorities
1. Maintain/improve respiratory function.
2. Prevent complications.
3. Support recuperative process.
4. Provide information about disease process, prognosis, and treatment.

## Nursing Interventions
These nursing interventions, if implemented appropriately, would result in the achievement of the goals of the management of pneumonia.

**To improve airway patency:**

- [ ] **Removal of secretions.** Secretions should be removed because retained secretions interfere with gas exchange and may slow recovery.
- [ ] Adequate hydration of 2 to 3 liters per day thins and loosens pulmonary secretions.
- [ ] Humidification may loosen secretions and improve ventilation.
- [ ] **Coughing exercises.** An effective, directed cough can also improve airway patency.
- [ ] **Chest physiotherapy.** Chest physiotherapy is important because it loosens and mobilizes secretions.

**To promote rest and conserve energy:**

- [ ] Encourage avoidance of overexertion and possible exacerbation of symptoms.
- [ ] **Semi-Fowlerâ€™s position.** The patient should assume a comfortable position to promote rest and breathing and should change positions frequently to enhance secretion clearance and pulmonary ventilation and perfusion.

**To promote fluid intake:**

- [ ] **Fluid intake.** Increase in fluid intake to at least 2L per day to replace insensible fluid losses.

**To maintain nutrition:**

- [ ] Fluids with electrolytes. This may help provide fluid, calories, and electrolytes.
- [ ] Nutrition-enriched beverages. Nutritionally enhanced drinks and shakes can also help restore proper nutrition.

**To promote patientâ€™s knowledge:**

- [ ] Instruct patient and family about the cause of pneumonia, management of symptoms, signs, and symptoms, and the need for follow-up.
- [ ] Instruct patient about the factors that may have contributed to the development of the disease.

## Evaluation
Expected patient outcomes include the following:

- [ ] Demonstrates improved airway patency.
- [ ] Rests and conserves energy by limiting activities and remaining in bed while symptomatic and then slowly increasing activities.
- [ ] Maintains adequate hydration.
- [ ] Consumes adequate dietary intake.
- [ ] States explanation for management strategies.
- [ ] Complies with management strategies.
- [ ] Exhibits no complications.
- [ ] Complies with treatment protocol and prevention strategies.

## Discharge and Home Care Guidelines
Patient education is crucial regardless of the setting because self-care is essential in achieving a patientâ€™s well-being.

- [ ] **Oral antibiotics.** Teach the patient about the proper administration, potential side effects, and symptoms to report.
- [ ] **Breathing exercises.** Teach the patient breathing exercises to promote secretion clearance and volume expansion.
- [ ] **Follow-up check up.** Strict compliance to follow-up checkups is important to check the latest chest x-ray result or physical examination findings.
- [ ] **Smoking cessation.** Smoking should be stopped because it inhibits tracheobronchial ciliary action and irritates the mucous cells of the bronchi.

## Documentation Guidelines
Documentation of data must be accurate and up-to-date to avoid unnecessary legal situations that might occur.

- Document breath sounds, presence and character of secretions, use of accessory muscles for breathing.
- Document character of cough and sputum.
- Document respiratory rate, pulse oximetry/O2 saturation, and vital signs.
- Document plan of care and who is involved in planning.
- Document clientâ€™s response to interventions, teaching, and actions performed.
- Document if there is use of respiratory devices or airway adjuncts.
- Document response to medications administered.
- Document modifications to plan of care.
